      "label": "Description",
      "value": "The lettering refers to the phrenological organ allocated to each section of the head. 1. Benevolence: Peel stands on a platform holding corn before a crowd of supplicants. 2. Secretiveness: Peel stands astride a locked trunk marked \"Peel's opinions\". 3. Firmness: Peel, keeling over backwards, is pushed upright by the Duke of Wellington and Queen Victoria. 4. Adhesiveness: a blank space, suggesting lack of steadfastness. 5. Distructiveness [sic]: Peel applies a syphon marked \"Income tax\" to the side of a bull which has a name-tag \"Taxes\". 6. Comparison: before election Peel goes down on bended knee to beseech the electors, while after election they go down on bended knee to beseech him. 7. Wonder: Peel ponders his future. 8. Hope: Peel as a Jack o'Lantern leads the manufacturers into a swamp by holding out a lantern marked \"Protection\". 9. Cautiousness: Peel stands blindfolded in front of bales marked \"League\" (i.e. Anti-Corn Law League) and \"State trials\". 10. Language: Peel as a three-headed statue saying \"Yes\" (left), \"No\" (right), and \"I reserve my opinion\" (centre)"
