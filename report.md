- IIIF is still an evolving technology
- Legacy and immature IIIF implementations exist
- For harvesting a IIIF endpoint, some requirements, specific for harvesting, must be supported at the provider (IIIF Collection, or another standard) 

Europeana may need to define requirements (a IIIF profile?) for IIIF endpoints to be ingested,  at similar quality
