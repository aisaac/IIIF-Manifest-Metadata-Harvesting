# Relevant stuff for IIIF harvesting

## List of Lists of IIIF content

- [crowdsourced top-level collection manifests, in spreadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1apQKFkfBV89BvycaBPN6v-LjeaKaVVMaMUsY6L4KRJo/)

- [crowdsourced top-level collection manifests, machine-readable] (https://github.com/ryanfb/iiif-universe) 
  - a manifest of manifests
  - not the same coverage as previous list

- [list of IIIF partners, can be used to mine sources] (http://iiif.io/community/)

## 3 aspects of discovery:

- Discovery of IIIF images: Provides the IIIF image URL from the repository
- Discovery of IIIF display: Provides IIIF manifests available from the repository
- Discovery of metadata associated with the IIIF resources


## Examples for methods for discovery

- https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/ - paginated lists of IIIF resources at IA
- https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/collection.json?q= - search within collection of manifests from IA
- https://github.com/IIIF/iiif.io/blob/master/source/event/2014/london_notes.md#discovery-of-objects - old idea of sitemap for IIIF


## Our possible contributions to the community

- list of weird stuff happening wrt what the spec recommends, such as wrong use of seeAlso.
